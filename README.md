# I Will Remember You - Visual Novel

## Overview
"I Will Remember You" is a visual novel that immerses players in the life of 19-year-old Jay, a typical college student in Tokyo, Japan. One evening, a chance encounter turns his entire life—and even the afterlife—upside down in a dramatic twist of fate.

## Genre and Core Aspects
This single-player visual novel features point-and-click elements with a strong narrative focus. At the heart of the game is the essence of human life. Everyone faces trials and tribulations, and how one deals with pain can alter the course of their life. "I Will Remember You" explores this theme through the perspectives of humanity's defining philosophies, incorporating thoughts and theories from Stoicism, Rationalism, Existentialism, and Nihilism. The game weaves these concepts metaphorically into conversations with its characters. While it does not aim to answer such complex questions for the player, it encourages reflection by offering new viewpoints.

## Unique Features & Original Production
All backgrounds and characters for the novel have been created using the artificial intelligence tool Midjourney. Each image has undergone dozens of iterations (an average of 20-40 generations per image, approximately 50 for characters) and prompt adjustments to achieve the perfect result. This time-intensive process has allowed for the creation of a unique visual experience, with each background being a masterpiece in its own right.

"I Will Remember You" stands on par with the visual quality of the world's best and largest anime studios. The game leverages the potential of new AI technologies, which are being used worldwide across various industries to optimize work processes, setting new standards for the visual novel genre.

Furthermore, the story is uniquely written, infused with profound philosophical and psychological themes.
